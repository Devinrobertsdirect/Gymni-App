## 📋 Pre-Submission Steps

### 1. Build the IPA
```bash
cd a0-project
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### 2. Download IPA
Once the build completes:
- Download the IPA from the EAS build page
- Save it to a memorable location
- The IPA can be zipped and shared if needed

### 3. Test the Build
- Install on a physical device via TestFlight or direct install
- Test critical flows:
  - [ ] App launches without white screen
  - [ ] Login/signup works
  - [ ] Firebase connection works
  - [ ] API calls succeed
  - [ ] Images and assets load correctly
  - [ ] Navigation between screens works
  - [ ] Video playback works (if applicable)

### 4. Submit to App Store
```bash
eas submit --platform ios --profile production
```

## 🎯 The a0-project Folder is Your Submission

**IMPORTANT**: The `a0-project` folder contains your complete, standalone app.

- This folder should be used for all builds
- All necessary files are self-contained
- Do NOT build from the parent directory
- The IPA built from this folder is production-ready

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### White Screen on Launch
**Cause**: Missing entry point or asset bundling issue
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Already fixed: `main: "index.ts"` in app.json
- ✅ Already fixed: Asset bundle patterns configured

### Build Failures
**Cause**: Missing dependencies or incorrect configuration
**Solution**:
- ✅ Already fixed: package.json has all required dependencies
- ✅ Already fixed: All config files present

### Assets Not Loading
**Cause**: Asset paths or bundling configuration
**Solution**:
- ✅ Already fixed: metro.config.js configured
- ✅ Already fixed: Assets in correct directory structure

## 📱 Post-Submission

### Monitor for Issues
1. Check Firebase Console for errors
2. Monitor crash reports in App Store Connect
3. Review user feedback in App Store
4. Check API logs for errors

### Update Workflow
When you need to release an update:
1. Make your changes in `a0-project`
2. Increment build number in `app.json`
3. Run `eas build --platform ios --profile production`
4. Test the new build
5. Submit via `eas submit --platform ios --profile production`
