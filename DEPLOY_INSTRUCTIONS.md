## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Not logged in to Expo"
```bash
eas login
```
Enter your Expo credentials.

### "Build failed"
Common causes:
1. **Missing dependencies**: Run `npm install` in a0-project
2. **Configuration error**: Check `eas.json` and `app.json`
3. **Network issue**: Check internet connection
4. **Expo account issue**: Verify account on expo.dev

### "Submission failed"
Options:
1. **Retry**: Run `eas submit --platform ios --profile production` again
2. **Manual upload**: 
   - Download IPA from expo.dev
   - Upload via Transporter app
   - Or upload via App Store Connect web interface

### "Invalid Apple credentials"
1. Verify Apple ID is correct
2. Generate app-specific password if using 2FA
3. Ensure account has access to Team ID `MLXSWDC63Q`

### "Build takes too long"
- Normal build time: 15-20 minutes
- If >30 minutes: Check build logs at expo.dev
- May need to wait for Expo server queue
